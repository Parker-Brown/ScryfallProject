Debug Case Test Log

Search: The following test searches are consistent with Scryfall behavior
	- Comma: "Urborg, Tomb of Yawgmoth"
	- Split cards: "find finality"
	- Double sided cards: "insectile aberration"
	- Large Searches: "t a c o"    (returns all cards with all letters in name)
	- Escape Characters: "\n\tsnap" 
	- Recovery from failed searches: "failed search 1"    
	
Search -> Select:
	- search but don't select
	 
Modify -> Check Price:
	-with and without price data available	

Modify -> Add Tag:	
	-escape characters ""\n""
	-empty tag ""  (sure, why not?)
	-adding duplicate tag 
	-cards with comma: "Tatyova, Benthic Druid"
	-add multiple tags to one card
	
Modify -> Remove Tag:
	-remove last instance of tag
	-remove one from many
	
Manifest: 
	-included are text files "card draw" , "ramp", and "lands matter", read in at start

Fixes:
	-Odd spacing if searches failed
	-if quitting after failed search program would still ask to select a card
	-spacing consistency (new line between menus, input, and results)
	-adding tags always added to the first tag file in the array
	-removal removed from internal array but not file
